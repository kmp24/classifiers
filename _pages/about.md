I'm and experienced GIS user who is making the transition from traditional GIS to a data science skillset. I have a variety of experiences working for federal land management agencies, and the commericial real estate industry. At present, I'm working as a recently promoted project coordinator for a research firm. I manage everything from data delivery to clients, database design, and data analysis. I have also been put in charge of automation, innovation, and process improvement (in addition to being a project coordinator) because of my aptitude and passion for automation!
